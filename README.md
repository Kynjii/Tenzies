# Tenzies - React
This project is part of the challenges in the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). It's another fun and practical way I've been sharpening my React skills while building something interactive and engaging.

## About the Project
Tenzies is a dice game where the goal is to match all dice to the same number. Itâ€™s built using React and focuses on state management and interactivity. This project was a great opportunity to apply what Iâ€™ve learned about React while also improving my problem-solving skills.

### Features:
- Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Dynamic rendering of dice and game state
- Reset functionality to replay the game

## What I Learned

This project helped me:
- **Understand state updates**: Managing state for multiple dice and ensuring everything updated correctly was a fun challenge.
- **Use conditional rendering**: Reactâ€™s ability to dynamically render UI based on state made it easy
- **Work with arrays in state**: Updating and mapping through arrays in state is a common pattern in React, and this project gave me good practice. ðŸ¤£

## Scrimba Career Path Challenges

The Scrimba course continues to be a great resource for hands-on learning. Each challenge builds on the previous one, and Tenzies really pushed me to think critically about state management and user interaction.

### Other Takeaways from the Course
- Deeper understanding of how Reactâ€™s reactivity works.
- Better at breaking down problems into smaller, solvable pieces.
- Improved at debugging when things donâ€™t work as expected.
